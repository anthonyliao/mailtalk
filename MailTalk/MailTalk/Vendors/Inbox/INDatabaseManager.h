/**
 The INDatabaseManager is responsible for maintaining a local cache of INModelObjects.
 It is built on top of FMDB (which is itself a wrapper on SQLite.) Objects are stored
 in the database in tables that are auto-generated for each class based on the class
 configuration.
 
 In each table, full JSON representations of objects are stored in a BLOB column called 'data'.
 Individual table columns and indexes are created for the properties returned from
 INModelObject -databaseIndexProperties. This means that queries for a particular class
 can only use the properties returned from -databaseIndexProperties, but also ensures
 that objects are stored in their entirety, queries only use indexed columns,
 and objects do not need to be separately transformed into an SQLite-friendly representatation
 for local storage.

 The INDatabaseManager is inspired by CoreData, and also by YapDatabase.
