/** The INThread class provides a native wrapper around Inbox threads
 http://inboxapp.com/docs/api#threads

Threads are the central object of the Inbox API and the INThread class 
provides convenience methods for performing many actions, such as tagging,
archiving, and deleting threads.

You should not create instances of INThread directly. Instead, obtain an
INNamespace object (representing an email account) and use an INThreadProvider:
 
    NSPredicate * unread = [NSComparisonPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"ANY tagIDs = %@", INTagIDUnread];
    INNamespace * namespace = [[[INAPIManager shared] namespaces] firstObject];
    self.threadProvider = [namespace newThreadProvider];
    self.threadProvider.itemFilterPredicate = unread;
    self.threadProvider.delegate = self;
 
    // Implement the INModelProviderDelegate protocol to get threads
	
If you're looking to create a new thread, see INDraft.

 new threads the user may be interested in.

 - Threads become "unseen" again if new messages arrive in the thread.
