/**
Drafts are messages that may be sent, saved, and deleted. You can create new drafts
using one of the designated initializers, save them, add files, and send them using
the methods documented below. The Inbox framework takes care of persisting pending
draft operations, ensuring that -save, -send and other methods are eventually persistent,
even if they are called when the user is offline.

To list drafts available in a namespace, retrieve an INMessageProvider from the namespace.

Drafts receive a new ID each time they are saved. If your application is presenting a draft,
be prepared for the draft's ID to change after calls to -save. You can monitor changes all
Inbox objects by subscribing to INModelObjectChangedNotification.
